# WatchIT

A simple file tracker (created, renamed, deleted, edited) that keeps a list
of all changes to a folder.

It was written to track changes to projects I was involved in. Projects that
had no source control, the source was in a ftp or I was just handed a folder.
When these project has a huge size and changes over time it becomes hard to
know what files has been changed. And thus I decided to write a tool to help
me keep track of things.

## Features

* Add/Remove *paths* to monitor.
* A information window for each *Path* showing what has changed.
* Ability to remove changes (one by one and everything)
* DragDrop a change to another window (FileDrop)

DragDrop functions carry over either the folder or file path. I use it to
upload files via FileZilla, or open them in editor.
