# WatchIT

A simple file tracker (created, renamed, deleted, edited) that keeps a list
of all changes to a folder.

It was written to track changes to projects I was involved in. Projects
that had either no source control and the only source was in a ftp. When
these project became big it would become hard to track what files I had 
changed. Thus the tool!

Features:
	Add/Remove Paths to monitor.
	InfoWindow for each Path showing what has changed.
	Ability to remove changes (one by one and everything)
	DragDrop a change to another window (FileDrop)
